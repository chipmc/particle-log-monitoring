# Tools Guide

Local inspection and diagnostic tools for particle-log-monitoring.

## Telemetry Operator CLI

### Purpose

Use the deployed telemetry stack without memorizing DynamoDB table names, API Gateway URLs, or Particle device IDs.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- AWS CLI authenticated for the account and region containing `InfraStack`
- Deployed `InfraStack` with `DeviceCurrentStateTableName` and `QueryApiBaseUrl` outputs
- `PARTICLE_ACCESS_TOKEN` in the local shell or `~/.particle-log-monitoring/secrets.env` for Particle inventory lookups

If your AWS CLI profile does not have a default region, pass `--region <region>` or set `AWS_REGION`/`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`.

Particle credentials are local operator credentials. The CLI prefers `PARTICLE_ACCESS_TOKEN` from the current shell and then reads `~/.particle-log-monitoring/secrets.env` if present. It does not use the deployed Lambda environment as the normal Particle credential source and never prints token values.

### Quick Start

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Maker/AWS/particle-log-monitoring

./tools/telemetry devices
./tools/telemetry fleet
./tools/telemetry device e00fce68399ee6244a963935
./tools/telemetry timeline e00fce68399ee6244a963935 --hours 24
./tools/telemetry watch P2-NewCode-Dev
```

### Commands

```bash
./tools/telemetry --help
./tools/telemetry help [command]
./tools/telemetry devices
./tools/telemetry fleet --product-id 42131
./tools/telemetry device <name-or-device-id>
./tools/telemetry timeline <name-or-device-id> --hours 24 --limit 50
./tools/telemetry watch <device-selector>
```

Use `./tools/telemetry <command> --help` or `./tools/telemetry help <command>` for command-specific help. Help commands run locally and do not require AWS authentication or network access.

All data commands support `--json`. Device selectors accept a full Particle device ID, exact device name, or unambiguous partial device name. The tool discovers deployed resources from CloudFormation and uses the existing query API for timeline reads.

### Fleet Summary

```bash
./tools/telemetry fleet
./tools/telemetry fleet --product-id 42131
./tools/telemetry fleet --json
./tools/telemetry fleet --verbose
```

`fleet` is the first Fleet Operations summary command. It scopes the report to one Particle product, defaulting to Product `42131`, and joins Particle product inventory, `DeviceCurrentState`, and the existing runtime projection. It does not infer health.

`fleet` requires a local Particle operator token because Product inventory comes from the Particle API. Source the local operator cache before running if the token is not already in your shell:

```bash
source "${HOME}/.particle-log-monitoring/secrets.env"
echo "PARTICLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=${PARTICLE_ACCESS_TOKEN:+SET}"
```

The confirmation command reports only whether a token is set; it does not expose the token.

The text report includes:
- Fleet header
- Coverage counts
- Connected counts
- Firmware distribution
- Device OS distribution
- Device table

Options:
- `--product-id <id>`: Particle product ID. Default is `42131`.
- `--json`: Emit stable `fleet-summary.v1` JSON.
- `--verbose`: Include additional per-device metadata, such as Particle last-heard time, Ledger update time, and last event type.

`fleet --json` uses the same internal Fleet Summary object as the text renderer. `fleet --verbose --json` includes the additional per-device metadata in the JSON device records.

Coverage in `fleet-summary.v1` JSON is reported with stable keys:

```json
{
  "coverage": {
    "inventory": 12,
    "currentState": 11,
    "runtimeStatus": 10,
    "deviceData": 9
  }
}
```

### Watch Cheat Sheet

```bash
./tools/telemetry watch P2-NewCode-Dev
./tools/telemetry watch P2-NewCode-Dev --since 5m
./tools/telemetry watch P2-NewCode-Dev --interval 3
./tools/telemetry watch P2-NewCode-Dev --serial-only
./tools/telemetry watch P2-NewCode-Dev --types serial,lifecycle,runtime
./tools/telemetry watch P2-NewCode-Dev --exclude serial
./tools/telemetry watch P2-NewCode-Dev --json
./tools/telemetry watch P2-NewCode-Dev --raw
```

`watch` resolves a device name or device ID once at startup, then polls the Timeline API and `DeviceCurrentState`. It displays new activity oldest-first, suppresses duplicates, automatically retries transient API failures, and continues until Ctrl-C. Serial output is near-live cloud-forwarded serial data, not a direct USB serial connection.

Options:
- `--interval <seconds>`: Polling interval. Default is the implemented V1 default. Minimum one second.
- `--since <duration>`: Show recent history before beginning the live watch, for example `5m`.
- `--types <csv>`: Include only selected categories.
- `--exclude <csv>`: Exclude selected categories.
- `--serial-only`: Display only cloud-forwarded serial log events.
- `--json`: Emit machine-readable JSON lines.
- `--raw` / `--full`: Do not truncate long event or serial-log content.

Categories:
- `SERIAL`: Cloud-forwarded serial logs.
- `TELEMETRY`: Normal device telemetry and published measurements.
- `OCCUPANCY`: Occupancy/count changes where classified separately.
- `LIFECYCLE`: Particle webhook event named `status`, including reset-related lifecycle information.
- `RUNTIME`: `device-status` Ledger snapshot changes.
- `DATA`: `device-data` Ledger snapshot changes.
- `EVENT`: Other device events.
- `ERROR`: Error or failure activity.

Firmware development workflow:

```bash
# Terminal 1
./tools/telemetry watch P2-NewCode-Dev --since 2m

# Terminal 2
# Particle firmware build/flash and local development commands
```

This avoids repeatedly issuing `timeline` during firmware testing while still using the deployed telemetry pipeline.

Planned enhancement: `watch` and `timeline` will later share optional terminal color highlighting, respecting non-TTY output and `NO_COLOR`.

## Device Timeline Inspector

- Works with Phase 1 and additive Phase 2A records

**Does NOT:**
- Modify DynamoDB or S3
- Change Lambda behavior
- Modify or replay normalized records
- Write to AWS resources
- Require infrastructure deployment

**Key metrics explained:**

- **Total Events**: Number of events in query window
- **Time Span**: Duration from first to last event
- **Ingest Performance**: Latency between device event time and ingestion (receivedAt - eventTime)
  - Average is typical latency
  - High max values may indicate network issues
- **Event Counts**: Breakdown by event name, sorted by frequency
- **Firmware Versions**: All firmware versions seen
- **Time Gaps**: Periods with no events exceeding threshold
  - Useful for detecting device offline periods
  - Default threshold: 90 minutes
- **Event Bursts**: Clusters of 3+ events within 10 minutes
  - May indicate device reconnection/retry behavior
  - May indicate unusual activity
- **Anomalies**: Detected issues
  - Missing eventTime
  - High ingest delay (> 5 seconds and > 2x average)
  - Repeated burst patterns

#### un timeline -- --deviceId e00fce68e4fa8ab3f8faa207 --hours 24 --summary
```

**When to use:**
- Quick health check with metrics
- Identify patterns and anomalies
- Detect reporting gaps or bursts
- Performance analysis
- Pre/post-deployment comparison

**Summary includes:**
- Event count by event name
- First/last event time and time span
- Ingest performance (average/min/max delay)
- Time gaps larger than threshold (default 90 min)
- Event bursts (3+ events within 10 minutes)
- Firmware versions seen
- Serial lifecycle event counts (if present)
- Detected anomalies

**Custom gap threshold:**
```bash
npm run timeline -- \
  --deviceId e00fce68e4fa8ab3f8faa207 \
  --hours 24 \
  --summary \
  --gap-threshold 30
```

#### 6. Get Device Health Diagnostics

```bash
npm run timeline -- --deviceId e00fce68e4fa8ab3f8faa207 --hours 24 --health
```

**When to use:**
- Device health assessment
- Battery monitoring
- Connection quality check
- Reset count tracking
- Temperature monitoring
- Alert detection
- Firmware version validation

**Health diagnostics includes:**
- Battery: latest, min, max, average, change over window
- Connection time: latest, min, max, average (detects high connection times)
- Reset count: latest, change (detects increasing resets)
- Alert count: latest, non-zero detection
- Temperature: latest, min, max, average, change
- Occupancy metrics: current and daily counts
- Firmware versions and changes during window
- Anomaly detection:
  - Battery < 30% (medium severity)
  - Battery < 20% (high severity)
  - Connection time > 180s (medium/high severity)
  - Reset count increasing (medium/high severity)
  - Active alerts detected (high severity)
  - Firmware version changes (low severity)
  - Rapid battery drain > 30% (medium severity)

**Note:** Health mode fetches all S3 payloads to parse device telemetry data. This is more intensive than summary mode but provides detailed device health insights.

#### 7. Event Correlation Analysis

```bash
npm run timeline -- --deviceId e00fce68e4fa8ab3f8faa207 --hours 24 --correlate
```

**When to use:**
- Identify root causes of device issues
- Investigate connectivity problems
- Analyze reboot patterns
- Detect causal relationships between events
- Debug intermittent failures
- Pattern detection across event types

**Correlation analysis includes:**
- Groups events into configurable time windows (default 5 minutes)
- Correlates telemetry, watchdog, status, serial lifecycle, and serial logs
- Extracts and displays:
  - Telemetry: battery, connection time, temperature, resets, alerts, occupancy
  - Watchdog events with reset causes
  - Status data: cloud recovery stage, network state, queue depth
  - Serial lifecycle: connect/disconnect/missing events
  - Serial logs: categorized by modem, network, power, error, reconnect
- Applies 8 heuristic inference rules:
  1. Connectivity degradation (high connection time + modem errors)
  2. USB instability (repeated serial connect/disconnect)
  3. Network stall causing watchdog
  4. Device reboot (reset count increase + watchdog)
  5. Power anomaly (low battery + alerts)
  6. Reconnect loop (multiple reconnect attempts)
  7. High connection time (> 180s)
  8. Critical battery (< 20%)
- Shows summary with total inferences, severity counts, top categories
- Each inference includes severity (CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO), category, message, evidence

**Custom window size:**
```bash
# Use 10-minute windows for broader pattern detection
npm run timeline -- --deviceId e00fce68e4fa8ab3f8faa207 --hours 48 --correlate --window 10
```

**Note:** Correlation mode fetches all S3 payloads to analyze event relationships. It is the most comprehensive diagnostic mode, providing causal analysis beyond simple metrics.

- **Inference Rules**: 8 heuristic patterns detect:
  - Connectivity issues (high connect time, modem errors, reconnect loops)
  - Hardware problems (USB instability, watchdog resets)
  - Power anomalies (low battery with alerts)
  - Device reboots (reset count increases)
- **Evidence-Based**: Each inference shows supporting data
- **Severity Levels**:
  - 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Immediate action needed (watchdog, low battery + alerts)
  - ⚠️  **WARNING**: Monitor closely (high connect time, USB flapping, reconnect loops)
  - ℹ️  **INFO**: Informational (minor anomalies)

**Inference categories:**
- **connectivity**: Network and cellular issues
- **power**: Battery and power-related problems
- **stability**: Crashes, resets, watchdog events
- **hardware**: USB, serial, and physical device issues

**Window duration:**
- Smaller windows (2-5 min): Detect rapid event sequences

- Adjust with `--window <minutes>` based on investigation needs

### Troubleshooting

#### Error: Could not determine AWS resource names

**Cause:** Script cannot auto-detect DynamoDB table or S3 bucket.

**Solution 1:** Specify explicitly:
```bash
npm run timeline -- \
  --deviceId e00fce68e4fa8ab3f8faa207 \
  --table InfraStack-ParticleLogEventsTable123ABC \
  --bucket infrastack-rawparticlelogsbucket456DEF
```

**Solution 2:** Set environment variables:
```bash
export LOG_EVENTS_TABLE_NAME=InfraStack-ParticleLogEventsTable123ABC
export RAW_LOGS_BUCKET_NAME=infrastack-rawparticlelogsbucket456DEF
npm run timeline -- --deviceId e00fce68e4fa8ab3f8faa207
```

**Solution 3:** Verify CloudFormation stack exists:
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=particle-admin aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name InfraStack
```

#### Error: No events found

**Possible causes:**
1. Incorrect deviceId (check case and format)
2. Time range too narrow
3. Device hasn't reported yet
4. Events outside specified window

**Debugging:**
```bash
# Check recent events (wider window)
npm run timeline -- --deviceId <deviceId> --hours 168

# Check if device exists in DynamoDB
AWS_PROFILE=particle-admin aws dynamodb query \
  --table-name <TABLE_NAME> \
  --key-condition-expression "deviceId = :d" \
  --expression-attribute-values '{":d":{"S":"<deviceId>"}}' \
  --limit 1
```

#### Error: Access Denied

**Cause:** AWS profile lacks permissions.

**Solution:** Verify IAM permissions:
```bash
# Test DynamoDB access
AWS_PROFILE=particle-admin aws dynamodb describe-table \
  --table-name <TABLE_NAME>

# Test S3 access
AWS_PROFILE=particle-admin aws s3 ls s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/
```

Required permissions:
- `dynamodb:Query` on events table
- `s3:GetObject` on raw logs bucket

### Integration with Operations

This tool complements operational procedures documented in [operations.md](./operations.md):

**Pre-deployment:**
- Verify baseline device behavior
- Capture normal event patterns

**Post-deployment:**
- Validate synthetic test events
- Compare production device timelines
- Verify no missing events during burst

**Incident response:**
- Query device timeline during incident window
- Fetch raw events for forensic analysis
- Compare affected vs healthy devices

### Performance Notes

- Queries are indexed by `deviceId` (fast)
- Time-range filtering uses sort key (efficient)
- Limit parameter prevents excessive data transfer
- Raw S3 fetches incur additional latency
- Use specific time windows for better performance

### Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)

When canonical schema normalization is implemented:

- Display normalized `eventType` (stable classification)
- Show enriched fields (`plane`, `severity`, etc.)
- Filter by event plane (telemetry/forensic/serial)
- Search by semantic event type
- Timeline merge across multiple devices

Current tool will continue to work with Phase 1 schema during migration.
